# DBO-MAB: Dynamic Bayesian Optimisation for Multi-Arm Bandits
## ðŸš€ Overview

DBO-MAB is a novel algorithm that dynamically adapts hyperparameters of multi-arm bandit (MAB) algorithms using incremental Bayesian optimisation. It addresses the challenge of tuning MAB algorithms in uncertain and dynamic environments, particularly for applications like web server optimisation.
